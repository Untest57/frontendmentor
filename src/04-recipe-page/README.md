## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- SCSS

### What I learned

- List Marker Styling
- Using `cqw`
- I learned the meaning of `percentage` in `box-shadow` and `border-radius`.
  - Does not work in `box-shadow`
  - In `border-radius`, the percentage of the box height on each axis.
  
### Useful resources

- [List Marker Gap](https://css-tricks.com/everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-gap-after-the-list-marker/) - You can
  check what `padding, margin` looks like in the list mark.
